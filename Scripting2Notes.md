I waited 4 hours before midnight on the day this assignment was due to start it. God help me

I'm never sure how to format my statements and loops because this isn't exactly like c++

I'm having trouble figuring out how to actually get the emails sent. I think it's just an issue with my vm though

It's 10:30 pm and it doesn't work correctly on my system, but it's due in an hour and a half, so I'm just going to cut my losses and send it in like this. I hope it works on other systems, because I think it doesn't work because I wasn't able to install and setup sendmail correctly.
